# Overview

Outliers should be considered with continuous survey variables. There are no hard and fast rules for outlier identification, but [Tukey's Test]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier#Tukey%27s_fences) provides one method that is easy to apply in a standard way.

## Visualize

Visualizing the data is a first step for examining outliers. To demonstrate, package sastats includes a survey dataset with annual participation days for several outdoor recreation activities:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(sastats)

data(svy)
activities <- svy$act

glimpse(activities)
```

We can use 
```{r}

```
