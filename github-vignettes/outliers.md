# Overview

Outliers should be considered with continuous survey variables. There
are no hard and fast rules for outlier identification, but [Tukeyâ€™s
Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier#Tukey%27s_fences) provides
one method that is easy to apply in a standard way.

## Visualize

Visualizing the data is a first step for examining outliers. To
demonstrate, package sastats includes a survey dataset with annual
participation days for several outdoor recreation activities:

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(sastats)

data(svy)
activities <- svy$act
glimpse(activities)
#> Observations: 11,268
#> Variables: 4
#> $ Vrid <chr> "98", "99", "100", "101", "102", "103", "105", "106", "107", "...
#> $ act  <chr> "trail", "trail", "trail", "trail", "trail", "trail", "trail",...
#> $ part <chr> "Unchecked", "Unchecked", "Unchecked", "Unchecked", "Unchecked...
#> $ days <dbl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 15, 10, NA, 2, NA, NA, 10, NA,...
```
